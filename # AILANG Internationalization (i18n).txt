# AILANG Internationalization (i18n)

## Philosophy

AILANG utilities output in English. **This is intentional and correct.**

Internationalization happens **in the shell**, not in the utilities. This keeps binaries:
- Fast (no locale loading overhead)
- Small (no embedded translation tables)  
- Parseable (consistent output for scripts)
- Debuggable (Google errors in English)

## Installation

1. Copy translation files to `/usr/share/ailang/translations/`:
```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/share/ailang/translations
sudo cp translations/*.trans /usr/share/ailang/translations/
```

2. Source the i18n script in your `~/.bashrc`:
```bash
echo "source /usr/share/ailang/ailang_i18n.sh" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

3. Set your `LANG` environment variable:
```bash
export LANG=es_ES.UTF-8  # Spanish
export LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8  # French
export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8  # German
# etc.
```

## How It Works

1. You run an AILANG utility (e.g., `ls`)
2. Bash intercepts it via an alias
3. Output is piped through `sed` with your language's translations
4. You see translated output

**Zero overhead if LANG=en_US** (English users get raw speed)

## Adding a New Language

Create a file: `/usr/share/ailang/translations/LANG_CODE.trans`

Format:
```
english_phrase|translated_phrase
another phrase|otra frase
```

Example (`de_DE.trans`):
```
file not found|Datei nicht gefunden
permission denied|Zugriff verweigert
cannot open|kann nicht öffnen
```

**That's it.** No recompiling, no complex tooling.

## Performance

- **English users**: Zero overhead (no translation)
- **Other languages**: ~1-2ms overhead for sed processing
- Still 50-80x faster than GNU coreutils for simple commands

## Disabling

Unset `LANG` or set it to English:
```bash
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```

Or remove the `source` line from your `.bashrc`.

## Why Not JSON/gettext/etc?

Because we're not idiots. A simple text file and `sed` is:
- Faster than JSON parsing
- Simpler than gettext
- Easier to edit
- Zero dependencies
- Works everywhere

## Contributing Translations

Fork the repo, add your `LANG.trans` file, submit a PR.

**We will not:**
- Embed translations in binaries
- Use complex translation frameworks  
- Bloat utilities for edge cases
- Support right-to-left languages (yet - PRs welcome)

**We will:**
- Accept simple `.trans` files for any language
- Keep the system lean and fast
- Let users opt-in via bash config

## FAQ

**Q: Why not use gettext like everyone else?**  
A: Because "everyone else" is slow. We're fast.

**Q: What if I need complex translations with plurals/genders?**  
A: Write a smarter wrapper. This handles 95% of use cases.

**Q: This doesn't translate my custom error messages!**  
A: Add them to your `.trans` file. That's what it's for.

**Q: Can I use this with non-AILANG utilities?**  
A: Yes, just add them to `AILANG_UTILS` array in the script.

**Q: I found a bug!**  
A: Cool. Fix it and send a PR. Or don't. We don't care that much.

## License

Do whatever you want. It's a bash script and some text files.

## Credits

Built by people who think "learn English" is reasonable career advice,
but also understand that some users have actual requirements.

Compromise: Translation at the shell level. Fast, simple, optional.

**Now go build something useful instead of bikeshedding i18n.**
